Package
[`@undataforum/components`](https://github.com/UNDataForum/design-system/tree/master/packages/components)
is a library of React components built with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com).

## Install

Run

    yarn add @undataforum/components

to add it to your dependencies. Install peer dependencies `react`, `react-dom`
and `theme-ui`.

You need to wrap your app with a `ThemeProvider` and pass
[`@theme-ui/preset-base`](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/tree/master/packages/preset-base)
as theme (or a preset that is derived from this preset such as
[`@undataforum/preset`](/preset)):

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui';
import preset from '@theme-ui/preset-base';

const app = (
  <ThemeProvider theme={preset}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

The preset should not make any changes to to breakpoints, which are
[Styled System's default breakpoints](https://styled-system.com/api/#defaults)
`['40em', '52em', '64em']`.

Import components like this

```jsx
import { Avatars, PostPreview } from '@undataforum/components';
```

## Docs

Read the docs at https://design-system.undataforum.org/components. You can run
the docs locally with

    yarn workspace docs run dev

## Contributing

Work with two terminals. In the first terminal run

    yarn workspace @undataforum/components run watch

and in the second terminal run

    yarn workspace docs run dev

The first command watches for changes in the `@undataforum/components` workspace
and bundles the `@undataforum/components` package whenever it detects changes.
The second command launches the docs, which use the local
`@undataforum/components` package as dependency.
