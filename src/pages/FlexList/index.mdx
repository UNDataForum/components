# FlexList

A list based on [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) to render components horizontally.

## Props

| Prop     | Type              | Required |
| :------- | :---------------- | :------- |
| `render` | `func`            | `true`   |
| `values` | `arrayOf(object)` | `true`   |

In addition `FlexList` accepts [margin and padding props](https://rebassjs.org/props/#margin-and-padding).

## Examples

### Avatars Example

`FlexList` delegates rendering of `values` to `render` prop. This gives us full control over what `FlexList` can render. Objects in `values` must match destructured values of the `render` prop function argument, in this example `avatar` and `href`.

### Many avatars example

In this example we pass a `profiles` array into `values` an transform it with [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). The resulting objects must have `avatar` and `href` like in the previous example. It looks like the avatars are rendered in a grid, but they are not. Avatars are simply wrapping into a new line when the line is full an because they all have the same size it looks like a grid.

### Badges example

In this example we render badges instead of avatars. The `render` prop expects `color`, `href` and `text` with `color` being optional as noted in the [documentation for `Badge`](/Badge). Note that the last value in `values` does not contain `color`.

### Many badges example

In this example we provide a `badges` to `values`. Each value has `color`, `href` and `text` to match the `render` prop. Badges have different sizes and this is why the wrapping nature of `FlexList` is more visible in this example.
