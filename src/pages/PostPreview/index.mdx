# PostPreview

Preview for a post.

## Props

`PostPreview` includes all props from type [post](/types/post/). In addition it accepts [margin and padding props](https://rebassjs.org/props/#margin-and-padding).

## Examples

### One author

In this example we render a `PostPreview` with one author. Note that if you provide a `href` prop to an author inside the `author` array, it will be linked. If you link the entire `PostPreview`, do not provide `href` props for authors to avoid links inside a link.

### Two authors

In this example we render a `PostPreview` with two authors and do not provide `href` props to authors. This results in the authors not being linked.

### Many authors

In this example we render a `PostPreview` with many authors that wrap on smaller screens. This example shows how to map an authors array. In this case we remove `href` and create the `avatar` render prop.
